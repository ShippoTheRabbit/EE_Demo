//            This condition is usually caused by an immune response to food ingestion. However, the relationship between food allergy and EoE is complex. Unlike many well known food allergens which causes symptoms right after exposure such as hives, lip swelling, vomiting and breathing issues, the EoE allergen induced reactions are often delayed, and can develop over several days making it difficult to pinpoint the specific food allergen. Environmental allergies to substances like pollen, dust, mold and animals also appear to play a role in triggering EoE and exacerbating EoE symptoms.
