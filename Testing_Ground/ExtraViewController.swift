// Hi this is deleted because you have code for this screen in another swift file
// Although you might have created this file to make the name SignIn vs Login, I find keeping both files with same functionality to not make sense. This ends up confusing me, as I am making changes. I am deleting this one since the login for this screen is causing me issues. We can prompt people how they enter information(passwords) later. I just need easy access to code information and not have to go through a 3 step process to get into the page I need.
